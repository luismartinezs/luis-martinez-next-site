I'm trying to use markdown in combination with react components

What I want:

- Able to dynamically import mdx files / content for a dynamic blog
- Able to use react in markdown: mdx allows that
- Able to have metadata in each post

Alternative:

- Instead of using markdown, I can setup storyblok and add content there. It will be more flexible, but also more wiring
- It might be worth setting up Storyblok, just for learning

Way forward

- Setup Storyblok and get the blog content from there
  - [x] Storyblok space
  - [ ] Use storyblok in NextJS
  - [ ] Render blog posts from Storyblok
- Components I need
  - Video component
  - Rich text component
