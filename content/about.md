> I've been a scientist and an artist, now I'm a developer, which needs a bit of both

Hi! My name is Luis MartÃ­nez.

In August 2018 I decided to become a web developer ([learn about how I did it](/blog/from-jobless-to-junior-frontend-developer-in-5-months)).

Things I've done as a web developer:

- Web apps with **React** and VueJS
- Sites with **NextJS** and NuxtJS
- **Google Firebase** backends
- Styling with **Tailwind CSS** and Bootstrap 4 / Vue Bootstrap

I also know about PostCSS, NodeJS/Express, serverless and AWS, SCSS and Google sheets / Google Apps Script.

Things I've done in past lives:

- a PhD in science. ðŸ¤“
- Working as a project manager in IT.
- [A card game](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/rafaelgonzalez/final-boss-the-card-game). ðŸŽ²
- As a little kid I loved drawing. ðŸŽ¨ [I still do](https://www.artstation.com/luismartinez).

I like:

- Greek salad
- Wim hof
- Dark souls
- Jojo's bizarre adventure

My secret regret: not having started learning web development 10 years earlier.
